# Anna  
This project was made for the first Devathon ever held. The theme of Devathon 2016 was "Machines".

## Short description of Anna
Anna was created based on an idea I had come up with just before the Devathon. Anna is based on a simple AI that collects user input, and when asked: Responds with the best match amongst all the user input.  
  
The reason to why I chose to give "her" the name Anna is because I listened to the swedish song "Boten Anna" during development.
